# Studies described in Works _may_ have one or more related Works on file that
# are preregistrations of that study. 
# They are attached to the work via a bflc:Relationship node,
# the Relationship is qualified with a bflc:relation "has preregistration"
# The preregistration document itself is linked in the bflc:Relationship 
# via bf:accompaniedBy as a Work blank node of bf:genreForm preregistration,
# whose Instance (also a blank node) can have either a URL (bf:electronicLocator),
# a DOI (bf:identifiedBy > bf:Doi) or both.

# The example work below has two preregistrations: one is a clinical trial with a trialnumber identifier that also has a source (the registry as a skos concept) and the other is a preregistration document with a url and a DOI.
